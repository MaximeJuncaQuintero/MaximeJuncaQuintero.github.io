            <h1>Innovation Scoring Tool</h1>
            <p>Client: IP firm; MEDEF and CEA partnership.</p>
            <p>Person of Contact (POC): Eric Junca (IP Firm POC); Maxime Rousseau (CEA-MEDEF POC); Om Dighe (Technical POC)</p>
            <p>Project Length: Between 11 and 22 days</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>While working on projects that required assessing potential clients' innovativeness, I identified a critical gap in efficiently profiling companies for an IP firm initially and later for broader applications. Traditional methods were cumbersome, involving time-consuming meetings and manual data collection. The challenge was the absence of a standardized, efficient tool for quickly profiling and assessing the innovation capabilities of companies. This gap resulted in inefficient initial engagements and delayed support for innovation within organizations.</p>
            
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>My objective was to create the Innovation Scoring Tool, a comprehensive digital solution to streamline the profiling process. This tool aimed to facilitate quicker, more efficient assessments of companies' innovation levels, tailor support from incubators, accelerators, and funding institutions, and provide valuable data for monitoring the effectiveness of support structures in fostering innovation.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>I led the initiative from its inception, designing the first prototype of the Innovation Scoring Tool. Recognizing the need for specialized skills to enhance the tool, I am now managing the project and have employed a computer scientist to finalize the development. This strategic decision allows for the incorporation of advanced features and functionalities tailored to the evolving needs of our target users.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>Initial Concept and Proof of Concept: Began with a collaboration among project management, software engineering, and innovation experts to conceptualize the tool. The initial phase focused on creating a proof of concept, assessing innovation levels within organizations.</p>
            <p>Feature Development and Enhancement: Identified improvements from the prototype review and implemented new functionalities, ensuring the tool's precision and utility were refined.</p>
            <p>User Experience Design: Utilized design libraries to craft a high-quality, user-friendly interface, encouraging engagement and simplifying the innovation assessment process.</p>
                
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>The Innovation Scoring Tool, under development and garnering interest from key organizations like MEDEF and CEA, promises to revolutionize the profiling of companies for innovation potential, enhancing the efficiency of initial assessments and support program analysis. This digital solution is poised to streamline innovation profiling processes, reduce manual effort, and improve data analysis capabilities, marking a significant shift towards more efficient and strategic innovation support and lead generation.</p>
