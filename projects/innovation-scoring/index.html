            <h1>Innovation Scoring Tool</h1>
            <p>Client: IP firm; MEDEF and CEA partnership.</p>
            <p>Person of Contact (POC): Eric Junca (IP Firm POC); Maxime Rousseau (CEA-MEDEF POC); Om Dighe (Technical POC)</p>
            <p>Project Length: Between 11 and 22 days</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>While working on projects that required assessing potential clients' innovativeness, I identified a critical gap in efficiently profiling companies for an IP firm initially and later for broader applications. Traditional methods were cumbersome, involving time-consuming meetings and manual data collection</p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>My objective was to create the Innovation Scoring Tool, a comprehensive digital solution to streamline the profiling process. This tool aimed to facilitate quicker, more efficient assessments of companies' innovation levels, tailor support from incubators, accelerators, and funding institutions, and provide valuable data for monitoring the effectiveness of support structures in fostering innovation.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Led as Project Manager and Initial Developer, from designing the first prototype to managing advanced development stages with added functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>Initiated with conceptual discussions, moved to prototype development, and continuous enhancement based on feedback to refine the tool's precision and utility.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>This digital solution is poised to streamline innovation profiling processes, reduce manual effort, and improve data analysis capabilities, marking a significant shift towards more efficient and strategic innovation support and lead generation.</p>
