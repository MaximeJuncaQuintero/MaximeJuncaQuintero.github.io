            <h1>Impact of Product Categories on Business Performance Metrics – POWER BI Project</h1>
            <p>This project analyzes the impact of different product categories (Office Supplies, Furniture, Technology) on business performance metrics including sales revenue, order quantity, and profitability, covering data from 2014 to 2017.</p>
            
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This analysis explores consumer buying patterns and business strategies to understand how each product category affects overall business performance.</p>
            
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>To provide a detailed analysis of the correlations between product categories and business performance indicators, identifying trends that could guide future business decisions and strategy formulations.</p>
            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>Data was gathered from the "Business Analytics Dataset (2014-2017)" which includes comprehensive data on sales, customers, and product categories. Various analytical techniques were employed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzing sales trends across different product categories.</li>
                <li>Evaluating order quantities to identify demand patterns.</li>
                <li>Assessing profitability and discount strategies across categories.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Key findings include Technology having higher revenues despite lower sales quantities, steady demand for Office Supplies with consistent profitability, and Furniture showing variable performance influenced by promotions and economic conditions.</p>
            <p>Strategic insights suggest the need for tailored strategies for each category to maximize profitability and market penetration.</p>

            <h2>Tools and Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Power BI for data visualization</li>
                <li>Python and SQL for data manipulation and analysis</li>
            </ul>
