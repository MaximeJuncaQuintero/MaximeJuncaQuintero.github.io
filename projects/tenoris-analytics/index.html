            <h1>Tenoris Analytics</h1>
            <p>POC: Kayané Robach (Data Scientist POC), Jérémy Dallard (SDE POC), Frédéric Ghenassia (PM POC)</p>
            <p>Meeting Frequency: Weekly</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>I identified a significant gap in the market where individual investors lacked access to alternative financial data, which was predominantly utilized by institutional investors. This gap led to a disparity in investment decision-making capabilities.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>My objective was to democratize alternative financial data for individual investors across Europe by developing Tenoris Analytics. This platform aimed to collect, analyze, and present alternative financial data in an accessible and understandable format, enabling individual investors to make better-informed decisions.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>I led the initiative from concept to launch, overseeing the development. My responsibilities encompassed strategizing the technical architecture, assembling a skilled team, and ensuring our platform met its mission to empower individual investors.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>Developed infrastructure for data processing, created a GraphQL-based API, and constructed a robust back-office tool for data management and monitoring, implementing security measures for data integrity and user privacy.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>The Tenoris Analytics Proof of Concept has successfully showcased the potential to impact individual investors' access to alternative financial data, marking the initial steps towards democratizing financial information with plans for future expansion and exploration of dataset monetization. Despite being in the early stages, this initiative promises significant productivity improvements by streamlining data analysis processes and offering unique datasets that hold substantial standalone value or for integration into future platform developments.</p>

            <h2>Tools and Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kubernetes-based Data-Features Architecture that supports manual and periodic execution of data collection and processing tasks</li>
                <li>Back-Office Application developed for data management, including business data (companies, markets, securities/tickers) and platform data (user management, data features management)</li>
                <li>GraphQL API leveraged for our platform API, enabling flexible and efficient data access for both our web application and direct API users</li>
                <li>CRON jobs for automatic and manual data-feature executions, ensuring data freshness and accuracy. Introduced a Data-Feature Controller for manual launches and monitoring</li>
                <li>Security and User Management, secure environment with differentiated access levels for administrators, API users, and web users, ensuring data integrity and user privacy</li>
            </ul>
