            <h1>Impact of Transmission Type on Car Features and Market Dynamics</h1>
            <p>This project examines the influence of transmission types on various car features such as market pricing (MSRP), fuel efficiency (MPG), and engine horsepower. The analysis spans data from 1990 to 2017, addressing shifts in consumer preferences and manufacturing trends over nearly three decades.</p>
            
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The study explores how transmission types impact car features and market dynamics, identifying trends in automatic and manual transmission over a span of nearly three decades.</p>
            
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how transmission types correlate with car specifications and market dynamics, highlighting trends and preferences that could inform future automotive design and marketing strategies.</p>
            
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>As the sole researcher, I was responsible for the entire project scopeâ€”data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. My responsibilities included data cleaning and preparation using Python and Pandas, and data analysis utilizing statistical tools and visualizations in Python with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>Data Collection and Preparation: Utilized the "Car Features Dataset (1990-2017)" containing 11,915 rows across 16 columns. Data cleaning involved merging similar categories, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed MSRP trends over the years by transmission type.</li>
                <li>Investigated MPG trends, highlighting improvements in fuel efficiency.</li>
                <li>Explored the influence of transmission type on market categories and engine horsepower.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The analysis reveals distinct patterns in how transmission types influence car features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pricing Trends: Automatic cars generally command higher prices, with notable fluctuations influenced by economic conditions.</li>
                <li>Fuel Efficiency: Automatic vehicles show significant improvements in MPG, particularly after 2000, suggesting technological advancements.</li>
                <li>Market Influence: Automatic transmissions dominate in luxury and performance categories, indicating consumer preferences for convenience and power.</li>
                <li>Engine Horsepower: Automatics are prevalent in high horsepower ranges, reflecting a trend towards powerful yet user-friendly vehicles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tools and Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python (Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization)</li>
                <li>Jupyter Notebook for script execution and result documentation</li>
            </ul>
